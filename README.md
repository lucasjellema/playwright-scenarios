# playwright-scenarios
Some scenarios using Playwright - deeplink bookmarks, tactical integration, RPA, UI Healthcheck, Test Automation of User Interface, documenting web applications, customzing the client side of a web application.

You need to locally install the NPM module Playwright:

`npm i -D playwright`

This installs Playwright and browser binaries for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. Once installed, you can require Playwright in a Node.js script and automate web browser interactions. See [Playwright on NPM site](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright)

Folder *conclusion-timesheet* contains an example of how to deeplink bookmark a webapplication that requires Microsoft login and multiple navigation steps to make the application ready for use by the user. It also has an example of that same timesheet application: how to scrape data in order to do offline processing/analysis.
