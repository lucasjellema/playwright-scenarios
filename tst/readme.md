To get ready for testing:

I have installed (on the command line and as admin, just to be sure)
`npm i -D @playwright/test`

Then navigated into tst directory

And executed
`npx folio  --param browserName=chromium`

Running 
`npm test`

seems to also to the job (as this basically does the same thing through the package.json entry for test).
